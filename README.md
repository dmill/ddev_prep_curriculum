# Destination: Dev Preparatory Curriculum

## Get Ready for Transformation!
Hey there, and welcome to the preparatory curriculum for the inaugural class of Destination: Dev! If you were accepted into our class this summer, it is because we believe in you and have every expectation that you'll be able to use what you learn at DDev to become a professional, full-stack web developer. That being said, this program is going to be rigorous and fast-paced. We want to push you outside of your comfort-zone both inside and outside of the classroom, and help you to realize that you're capable of things you didn't think were possible. As philosopher William James said, "Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second". So, get ready to be challenged, but also get ready to have the time of your life and to take part in building a community that will last well beyond the 10 weeks we'll have together this summer.

## What's Covered
In order to ensure that we are able to hit the ground running on the first day of class, it is imperative that each of you develops a solid foundation for us to build upon. The purpose of this prep curriculum is to help you to become comfortable with the fundamental concepts of programming in Ruby, along with some of the other technologies that will be necessary to work first with Ruby and later with Rails and JavaScript. This curriculum will cover:

  1. Ruby Fundamentals
  2. Introduction to the Unix Command Line
  3. Introduction to HTML & CSS

## Time Commitment
Each of you is coming into this curriculum with a different level of preexisting experience both with Ruby and with programming in-general. Each of you also has a unique learning style and picks up concepts at a different rate. As such, each of you will take your own amount of time to finish this material and get comfortable with the concepts and writing code. However, to give you an upper estimate of the amount of time you can expect to devote to your preparation, **if you are coming into the course with very little to no programming experience, you should expect to spend 80-100 hours on preparation**.

## Feedback
Additionally, as you all know you are participating in the first iteration of Destination: Dev. So, it is very important that you take an active role in your learning process and give us feedback on any problems that you experience throughout the process. We know that we will make some mistakes, but we are committed to integrating your feedback and improving our curriculum and processes in real time. So, if anything in this guide is unclear, inconsistent, not detailed enough, or less than ideal in any way at all I want to know about it immediately! Please give me feedback often on Slack @doug or via email at doug@destinationdev.com.

With that, head over to [Part 0](part0_the_basics.md) and get ready to start learning!
