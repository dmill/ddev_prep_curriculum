# Want More?

Finished everything in the curriculum and still want to hone your skills some more before the start of class? No sweat! We've got you covered, and there is enough material available online to keep you busy for years. Here are a few great things to check out:

## Beginning Ruby by Peter Cooper

<https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Ruby-Novice-Professional-Experts/dp/1430223634>

This is a great intor book that goes into more detail than the Chris Pine book. Check this out if you want more reading material. FYI you can probably find a free PDF of this book online. It's easy to find free versions of a lot of programming books, so if there's something you're interested in but you're short on cash use google! :)

## The Rest of Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby

or

You should have already read chapters 1 and 2, but looking through the rest of this book will familiarize you with a lot of other important, more advanced concepts in OO design.

## Ruby Warrior by Bloc.io

Here's a fun programming game by Bloc.io that will help you continue to practice these concepts with a bit of a different twist:
