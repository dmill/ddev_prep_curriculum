# Learn to Program by Chris Pine

<https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html>

Learn to Program by Chris Pine is a great beginner book on programming in Ruby. It's even better because it's now available for free online. I recommend purchasing the new version of the book with added material to get some extra practice/concepts and to support the author, and especially to see the author's solutions to all of the problems in the book. However, this is not required and you can use the free online version if you don't feel you need the solutions.

Go through all of the chapters and do each of the problems yourself, using the [DDev Cloud9 Setup](part2_cloud9_setup.md), or the environment of your choice. Some of the material will be review, and some of the later chapters will be an introduction to the topics we're getting to later.

(*Note: don't follow his installation instructions - if you followed the last section about Cloud9 setup then you should be able to use that instead.*)
