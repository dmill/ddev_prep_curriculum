# Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas

You've already encountered these concepts a bit in the last section when we went over enumerables(remember how we passed each value in our enumerable into a block?), but let's look at them in more depth. In many programming languages, particularly functional programming languages, functions (i.e. methods in Ruby) are "first class". This means that they are a piece of data and can be passed around as such. Another language you may have worked with (or that you will work with soon) where this is the case is JavaScript. This kind of programming has less of an emphasis in Ruby, but it's still possible and quite powerful when the problem calls for it. We can pass blocks of code around as objects in Ruby using Procs and lambdas.

Without further adieu, here are some resources to check out to familiarize yourself with using Procs and lambdas:

## Exercises

These exercises were taken from App Academy's open-source prep curriculum repo, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/appacademy/post-acceptance-prepwork) if you're interested in looking at some more resources.

Make sure you `cd ./exercises/part5`, and then run the tests with `bundle exec rspec ./iterators_spec.rb`
