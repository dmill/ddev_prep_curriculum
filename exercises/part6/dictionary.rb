In this exercise, we're going to create a dictionary class.
A dictionary should hold entries in the form of a hash, with
words as keys and definitions as values. Like this:

{ "computer" => "a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations. Mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones are some of the different types of computers."}

You'll need methods to add new entries and search the existing entries.
