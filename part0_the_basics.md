# Part 0: The Basics

The Purpose of the material here is to get you acquainted with the most fundamental concepts in programming, and to get you solving some basic problems using the tools you'll learn about. Here, you'll get an introduction to Ruby syntax and the language features Ruby shares in common with all other imperative programming languages like C++, Java, and Python.

## Code Academy Ruby Course: Lessons 1-4

<https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby>

The very first thing you should do to begin your journey is complete the first 4 sections of Code Academy's course on basic programming in Ruby. Code Academy is a great tool because of it's interactivity and bite-sized segments. This is a great place to start, but *please don't go on past lesson 4 at this point*. The lessons in Code Academy provide a lot of hand-holding, and it's important for you to make sure you've internalized and practiced the concepts in the early lessons before moving on.

## Destination: Dev Introduction to Programming Guide

<http://www.destinationdev.com/introduction-to-programming>

After completing the initial Code Academy lessons, head on over and check out our guide to programming. This guide should be a review of the material covered in Code Academy. We've included quizzes along with each new concept, so you should complete each quiz and make sure that each topic makes sense to you.

Finally, Step 24, the final step in our Guide, links you to a number of practice problems on [repl.it](https://repl.it/). Repl.it provides an environment where you can write and run code in a number of different programming languages right in your browser. We've set up each problem in a Ruby environment with a number of tests. When you enter each one of the problems and hit the `Run >` button, each of the tests at the bottom of the page on the left will print out `false`. Your mission is to fill in the method provided with a solution that will print out `true` for each test. When all you see is `true` on the right-hand output side of the screen, then you know you're done with the problem and you're ready to move on.

Each of the problems also has a link to a solution we've put together, and many of the problems also have an advanced solution. For each problem, the normal solution will only use the concepts that you've seen so far in Code Academy and in our guide. If this is your first introduction to programming and problems like these, then *don't worry about understanding the advanced solutions right now*. These solutions are provided for students who already have a strong grasp on the basic concepts at-hand in the guide and need a bit more of a challenge. Later on, you can come back to these advanced solutions as you learn more.

Additionally, if you begin to struggle with any of the problems. Try a) going back and reviewing Code Academy and the DDev Guide. b) check out Ruby Monk and Code School below for additional review. c) Reach out to the the rest of the community on Slack and ask for help! You can also reach out to me personally on slack @doug or via email at doug@destinationdev.com.

## Code School

Next, check out [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby) and their free *Try Ruby* course. This Code School course will get into some topics that we haven't covered yet, but I recommend going through all of it and learning a few new things. If you like Code School, you can also get a monthly membership and try out some of their other paid courses, but this is not required.
